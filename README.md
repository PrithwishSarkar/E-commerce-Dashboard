# E-commerce Dashboard

A dashboard where we manage account and products of an e-commerce company.

Front end is written in React.js and backend in Node.js

Made an API in Node.js for user registration and login.

User will not be able to access product pages until je is logged in. Once logged in his details will be saved in local storage until he logs out.

The user details are saved and retrieved from a MongoDB database.

Future Plans:
•	Product details page.
•	Adding, updating and deleting products (planning to make an API for the same).
•	Product search.

Here are some screenshots of the Register page and Dashboard after login:
